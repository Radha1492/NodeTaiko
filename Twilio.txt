Subject: Request for High-Performance Machine to Enhance Automation Productivity
Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to bring to your attention a challenge I’ve been facing with my current VDI setup during the development and execution of automation test cases using Cypress.

The performance of my VDI, which is a Windows machine, is often quite slow, and at times it hangs during critical tasks like test script development, test execution, and debugging. This impacts both the speed and the efficiency of my work. Since Cypress test execution requires significant computational resources, the current setup struggles to handle the load effectively, causing delays and reducing productivity.

I have observed that developers typically use high-performance machines, and having access to similar hardware would significantly enhance my ability to:

Run Cypress tests more efficiently without interruptions or delays.
Accelerate development and debugging, ensuring quicker turnaround times for test case creation and maintenance.
Improve overall productivity by minimizing system-related disruptions, enabling me to focus more on automation and quality improvements.
I believe investing in a high-performance machine for automation purposes would not only help me deliver better results but also contribute to the team’s overall efficiency and project timelines.

If it’s feasible, I would greatly appreciate your consideration of this request. I’m happy to discuss this further and provide more details if needed.

Thank you for your time and support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
