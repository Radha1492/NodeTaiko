It sounds like your application may not be accepting the CSV file because of extra spaces or junk characters introduced during the writing process. This can happen due to improper formatting of the CSV file or encoding issues.

Here’s how you can avoid junk characters and extra spaces:
Trim Data Before Writing: Make sure that all data fields are properly trimmed to remove unnecessary spaces before writing to the CSV.

Escape Special Characters: Ensure that special characters such as commas, quotes, or line breaks in your data are escaped properly, as they may cause issues when processed by your application.

Set Proper Encoding: Ensure that the file is saved with proper encoding (UTF-8 without BOM).

Here is an improved version of your code that addresses these potential issues:

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('task', {
    writeToCSV({ filename, data }) {
      const csvFilePath = path.join(__dirname, filename);
      const headers = 'Email,FirstName,LastName,ClientName,GIT,AppName,Status\n';

      // Helper function to trim and escape CSV data
      const escapeCSV = (value) => {
        if (typeof value === 'string') {
          return `"${value.trim().replace(/"/g, '""')}"`;  // Escape quotes
        }
        return value;
      };

      // Check if the file exists. If not, create it with headers
      if (!fs.existsSync(csvFilePath)) {
        fs.writeFileSync(csvFilePath, headers);
      }

      // Prepare the data row by trimming and escaping fields
      const row = [
        escapeCSV(data.Email),
        escapeCSV(data.FirstName),
        escapeCSV(data.LastName),
        escapeCSV(data.ClientName),
        escapeCSV(data.GIT),
        escapeCSV(data.AppName),
        escapeCSV(data.Status)
      ].join(',') + '\n';

      // Append the cleaned data row to the CSV file
      fs.appendFileSync(csvFilePath, row);

      return null;
    }
  });
};


Explanation:
escapeCSV(): This function ensures that:

All string values are trimmed (removes leading/trailing spaces).
Any double quotes in the data are properly escaped (replacing " with "").
The data is enclosed in quotes to avoid any issues with special characters like commas.
Proper Formatting: We make sure that each row of data is correctly formatted as a comma-separated string with necessary escaping.

Appending Data: The formatted data row is appended to the CSV file without introducing unnecessary junk characters or spaces.

describe('Test to write unique emails for csvData_Testcase01', () => {
  it('should write 100 rows with unique emails for csvData_Testcase01 to the CSV file', function() {
    // Load the specific test case data from InputTestData.json
    cy.fixture('InputTestData').then((testData) => {
      const staticData = testData.csvData_Testcase01;  // Use data for csvData_Testcase01

      // Loop to generate 100 unique emails and write to CSV
      for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        const row = {
          Email: `test${i}@example.com`,  // Dynamically generate unique email
          ...staticData                   // Merge the rest of the static data
        };

        // Write to CSV with cleaned data
        cy.task('writeToCSV', {
          filename: 'test-data.csv',
          data: row
        });
      }
    });
  });
});


Additional Tips:
Check CSV Encoding: Make sure your application expects a UTF-8 encoded file. The code above should generate the file with UTF-8 encoding.

Validating CSV: You can open the generated CSV in a text editor (like Notepad++) or a CSV validator to ensure there are no invisible characters.

This should resolve the issue of junk characters or extra spaces in your dynamically created CSV file. Let me know if this works!

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Here is the complete and formatted code to dynamically generate a CSV file without junk characters or extra spaces. It includes a task in the config.js file and a Cypress test script that reads data from your InputTestData.json file under the fixture folder.

cypress.config.js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('task', {
    writeToCSV({ filename, data }) {
      const csvFilePath = path.join(__dirname, filename);
      const headers = 'Email,FirstName,LastName,ClientName,GIT,AppName,Status\n';

      // Helper function to trim and escape CSV data
      const escapeCSV = (value) => {
        if (typeof value === 'string') {
          return `"${value.trim().replace(/"/g, '""')}"`;  // Escape quotes and trim spaces
        }
        return value;
      };

      // Check if the file exists. If not, create it with headers
      if (!fs.existsSync(csvFilePath)) {
        fs.writeFileSync(csvFilePath, headers);
      }

      // Prepare the data row by trimming and escaping fields
      const row = [
        escapeCSV(data.Email),
        escapeCSV(data.FirstName),
        escapeCSV(data.LastName),
        escapeCSV(data.ClientName),
        escapeCSV(data.GIT),
        escapeCSV(data.AppName),
        escapeCSV(data.Status)
      ].join(',') + '\n';

      // Append the cleaned data row to the CSV file
      fs.appendFileSync(csvFilePath, row);

      return null;
    }
  });
};

Cypress Test Script
This script reads the data from the InputTestData.json file in the fixture folder, generates 100 unique email rows, and writes them to a CSV file.

describe('Test to write unique emails for csvData_Testcase01', () => {
  it('should write 100 rows with unique emails for csvData_Testcase01 to the CSV file', function() {
    // Load the specific test case data from InputTestData.json
    cy.fixture('InputTestData').then((testData) => {
      const staticData = testData.csvData_Testcase01;  // Use data for csvData_Testcase01

      // Loop to generate 100 unique emails and write to CSV
      for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        const row = {
          Email: `test${i}@example.com`,  // Dynamically generate unique email
          ...staticData                   // Merge the rest of the static data
        };

        // Write to CSV with cleaned data
        cy.task('writeToCSV', {
          filename: 'test-data.csv',
          data: row
        });
      }
    });
  });
});


Explanation:
Task in config.js:
escapeCSV() ensures that all values are properly trimmed and quotes are escaped to avoid issues with special characters.
The row is written in CSV format and appended to the file, ensuring no extra spaces or junk characters are added.
Cypress Test Script:
Reads the data from the JSON file (assuming you have a structure similar to this in your InputTestData.json file):

{
  "csvData_Testcase01": {
    "Email": "test1@example.com",
    "FirstName": "John",
    "LastName": "Doe",
    "ClientName": "ClientA",
    "GIT": "https://github.com/johndoe",
    "AppName": "App1",
    "Status": "Active"
  }
}


Generates 100 rows with unique email addresses (test1@example.com, test2@example.com, etc.) and writes them to the CSV.

Email,FirstName,LastName,ClientName,GIT,AppName,Status
"test1@example.com","John","Doe","ClientA","https://github.com/johndoe","App1","Active"
"test2@example.com","John","Doe","ClientA","https://github.com/johndoe","App1","Active"
"test3@example.com","John","Doe","ClientA","https://github.com/johndoe","App1","Active"
...


This should eliminate any junk characters and ensure your application accepts the CSV file correctly. Let me know if this works for you!

To enhance your Cypress test reports with test steps and descriptions, you can take the following approaches:

1. Using Mocha Hooks for Descriptive Steps:
You can use before, beforeEach, it, describe, and afterEach hooks to define logical steps and provide meaningful descriptions for each test in your Cypress scripts. Here’s how you can structure your tests to improve clarity in reports:

describe('Login Test Suite', () => {
    
    before(() => {
        // This runs once before all tests in this block
        cy.log('Setting up preconditions like navigating to the login page');
    });

    beforeEach(() => {
        // This runs before each test
        cy.visit('/login');
    });

    it('should allow the user to log in with valid credentials', () => {
        cy.log('Step 1: Enter valid username and password');
        cy.get('#username').type('user1');
        cy.get('#password').type('password1');
        
        cy.log('Step 2: Click on the login button');
        cy.get('#loginBtn').click();
        
        cy.log('Step 3: Verify the user is redirected to the homepage');
        cy.url().should('include', '/home');
    });

    afterEach(() => {
        // This runs after each test
        cy.log('Test execution completed');
    });
});


The cy.log() commands help you add descriptive steps directly into your test execution, which will be displayed in your test report. When the tests run, these steps will appear in your command log, making the report more meaningful for your QA team.

2. Leverage Cypress Mochawesome Report:
If you're already using Mochawesome for reporting, you can modify your tests to ensure that each step is clearly described in the report. Mochawesome provides a detailed view, including the logs you set in the test code, so the cy.log() commands will be visible.

Install Mochawesome and necessary dependencies:

npm install --save-dev mochawesome mochawesome-merge mochawesome-report-generator

Update cypress.config.js to include mochawesome as the reporter:

const { defineConfig } = require("cypress");

module.exports = defineConfig({
  reporter: 'mochawesome',
  reporterOptions: {
    reportDir: 'cypress/reports',
    overwrite: false,
    html: true,
    json: true,
  },
});

Run your Cypress tests, and you'll get a detailed report that includes the steps and descriptions.
3. Allure Reports for Detailed Step Reporting:
Allure Reports offer a more advanced way to show steps, logs, and test descriptions. You can use the Cypress Allure Plugin to enhance the level of detail in your test reports, showing each step clearly.

Steps to Implement Allure with Cypress:
Install Allure Reporter:

Install the necessary plugins and dependencies:

npm install --save-dev @shelex/cypress-allure-plugin
npm install --save-dev allure-commandline

Update cypress.config.js to configure the Allure plugin:

const { defineConfig } = require("cypress");

module.exports = defineConfig({
  reporter: 'junit',
  reporterOptions: {
    mochaFile: 'cypress/reports/results-[hash].xml',
    toConsole: true,
  },
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      require('@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin/writer')(on, config);
      return config;
    },
  },
});

Add Allure Annotations in Your Test:

In your test cases, you can add detailed steps and descriptions using Allure commands:

describe('Login Test Suite', () => {
    it('should allow the user to log in with valid credentials', () => {
        allure.startStep('Step 1: Enter valid username and password');
        cy.get('#username').type('user1');
        cy.get('#password').type('password1');
        allure.endStep();
        
        allure.startStep('Step 2: Click on the login button');
        cy.get('#loginBtn').click();
        allure.endStep();

        allure.startStep('Step 3: Verify the user is redirected to the homepage');
        cy.url().should('include', '/home');
        allure.endStep();
    });
});

Generate the Allure Report:

After running your tests, generate the Allure report with:

allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
allure open allure-report

This will generate a detailed report with all steps and descriptions visible.

4. Custom Reporter to Add Descriptions:
You can also implement a custom reporter if you need more control over the content in your reports. Cypress supports custom reporters, and you can define additional behavior to log each step with more detail.

5. Add Assertions for Better Reporting:
Another key to enhancing report quality is adding descriptive assertions to the tests. For example, instead of just asserting a URL, make sure to add a meaningful message that will reflect in your reports:

cy.url().should('include', '/home', 'Verify user is redirected to the homepage');

This assertion message will show up in the reports, giving manual testers more confidence in what is being validated.

Conclusion:
By using detailed test steps, logs, screenshots, and enhanced reporting plugins like Mochawesome or Allure, you can provide the manual QA team with more confidence in the automation results. The richer and more descriptive the report, the easier it will be for the manual QA team to trust the output of your automation tests.

1. Mochawesome Report:
Mochawesome reports are clean and visually appealing, with the following elements:

Summary Section: At the top, you'll see an overall test summary, showing the total number of tests, passed/failed tests, and skipped tests.
Test Details: Each test case is listed along with its status (pass/fail). You can expand each test case to see detailed logs, including the step-by-step execution and any assertions made.
Screenshots: If configured, screenshots of each test case or failed test steps can be embedded into the report.
Error Messages: For failed test cases, you'll see detailed error messages and stack traces, helping with debugging.
Example Screenshot of a Mochawesome Report:

Test Suite & Case: Displays a structured view of test suites and test cases.
Pass/Fail Indicators: Clear indicators for the status of each test (green for pass, red for fail).
Command Logs: Each Cypress command is logged in sequence, showing interactions with the application.
How to Improve Mochawesome Reports:
cy.log() Commands: Any log messages you include in your tests with cy.log() will appear as part of the test's command logs, improving visibility into each step.
Screenshots on Failure: Automatically include screenshots for failed steps using cy.screenshot().
2. Allure Report:
Allure reports are even more detailed and come with additional features for tracking test execution over time:

Dashboard: Provides a summary of test executions, including pass/fail status, execution time, and test distribution (how many tests passed/failed/skipped over time).
Step Details: Each test case is expanded into individual steps, showing exactly what was performed. These steps are customizable with allure.startStep() and allure.endStep() for clear breakdowns.
Attachments: Screenshots, logs, and even custom artifacts like videos can be attached to each step, making it easy to investigate failures.
Defect Tracking: Allure allows you to categorize failures into known issues, new defects, or potential bugs, making it useful for both QA and management.
Example Screenshot of an Allure Report:

Overview: The initial view shows an overall summary with key metrics like the number of passed/failed tests, execution trends, and failure analysis.
Step-by-Step Execution: Each test case is broken down into steps, with logs and screenshots attached to every step. You can drill into any test case to see the exact sequence of actions.
Detailed Logs: Similar to Mochawesome, logs for each test step are visible, providing rich information for both passed and failed tests.
Allure Report Features:
Step Annotations: Allure supports detailed step-by-step reporting, allowing you to see exactly which actions were taken during each test.
Graphs and Trends: Allure generates visual reports, including trends of test execution, to see how the health of the application evolves over time.

Instead of having in test report I want to create a separate file where I can Add Test Steps and Descriptions and status dynamically with date time stamp. how I can do this ?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To create a separate file where you can dynamically log test steps, descriptions, and statuses (along with timestamps) during Cypress test execution, you can follow this approach:

Steps to Create a Custom Log File
Use Node.js File System (fs) Module: Cypress allows interaction with the Node.js fs (file system) module. You can use this to create or append logs to a custom file.

Create a Task in setupNodeEvents: You'll need to define a custom task in the cypress.config.js file that handles writing to the log file. This task will be invoked from your test scripts whenever you want to log a test step, description, status, and timestamp.

Implementation:
Step 1: Add fs Module and Define a Task in cypress.config.js
In your cypress.config.js, define a new task for writing to a log file:

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      on('task', {
        logTestStep({ message }) {
          // Define the log file path
          const logFilePath = path.join(__dirname, 'test-steps-log.txt');
          
          // Create a timestamp for when the log is created
          const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
          
          // Define the log format
          const logEntry = `[${timestamp}] ${message}\n`;

          // Append the log entry to the file
          fs.appendFileSync(logFilePath, logEntry);

          return null; // Cypress requires a return value for tasks
        },
      });
    },
  },
};


This script does the following:

Uses fs.appendFileSync() to append each log entry to a file called test-steps-log.txt.
Prepends the log entry with a timestamp (formatted in ISO 8601).
Step 2: Create a Function to Log Test Steps in Your Cypress Tests
Now that you've defined the logTestStep task, you can call it from your test files. Here’s an example:

describe('Test with Custom Logging', () => {
  it('performs some steps and logs them', () => {
    
    // Log test step 1
    cy.task('logTestStep', { message: 'Test Step 1: Logging into the application - Passed' });

    // Example test step
    cy.visit('https://example.com');
    
    // Log test step 2
    cy.task('logTestStep', { message: 'Test Step 2: Visited the homepage - Passed' });

    // Example test step
    cy.get('#loginButton').click();
    
    // Log test step 3
    cy.task('logTestStep', { message: 'Test Step 3: Clicked login button - Passed' });

    // Example assertion
    cy.get('#welcomeMessage').should('contain', 'Welcome');

    // Log test step 4
    cy.task('logTestStep', { message: 'Test Step 4: Verified welcome message - Passed' });
  });
});


Step 3: Run Your Cypress Tests
Each time you call cy.task('logTestStep', ...), Cypress will append the message to the test-steps-log.txt file in the root of your project directory.
Step 4: View the Log File
After running your tests, you'll see the test-steps-log.txt file in the root of your Cypress project. It will look something like this:

[2024-09-26T10:30:15.123Z] Test Step 1: Logging into the application - Passed
[2024-09-26T10:31:12.456Z] Test Step 2: Visited the homepage - Passed
[2024-09-26T10:31:30.789Z] Test Step 3: Clicked login button - Passed
[2024-09-26T10:32:00.111Z] Test Step 4: Verified welcome message - Passed


Additional Enhancements:
Add More Information:

You can include more details such as test name, test suite, and any custom metadata like environment info.
Log Errors:

You can add a try/catch block around test steps to log errors or failed steps. Example:

cy.task('logTestStep', { message: 'Test Step: Action failed - Error' });

Create Logs for Each Test File:

Modify the log file path dynamically for each test suite or test case, e.g., using the test case name to create a separate log file for each test:
const logFilePath = path.join(__dirname, `logs/${testFileName}-log.txt`);

Conclusion:
By following this approach, you can dynamically create a separate log file during your test execution, containing detailed descriptions of test steps, statuses, and timestamps. This will provide better visibility to the manual QA team, and it can also be used as a backup for test reports.

Instead of .txt file I want to use excel file
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To log test steps, descriptions, and statuses with a timestamp dynamically in an Excel file, you can achieve this by using the xlsx library in Cypress. Here's how you can modify the solution to write the logs into an Excel file.

Steps to Create and Update an Excel File:
Install xlsx Library: The xlsx library will allow you to create and update Excel files. You can install it in your Cypress project using npm.

Run the following command in your project directory:

npm install xlsx

Create a Task in cypress.config.js: Define a custom task in the cypress.config.js file to write logs to an Excel file using the xlsx library.

Implementation
Step 1: Add xlsx and Define Task in cypress.config.js
In your cypress.config.js, configure a task to write the test steps and other details to an Excel file:

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const xlsx = require('xlsx');

module.exports = {
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      on('task', {
        logTestStepToExcel({ step, description, status }) {
          const logFilePath = path.join(__dirname, 'test-steps-log.xlsx');

          // Create a new workbook or load the existing one
          let workbook;
          if (fs.existsSync(logFilePath)) {
            // Load existing workbook
            workbook = xlsx.readFile(logFilePath);
          } else {
            // Create a new workbook
            workbook = xlsx.utils.book_new();
          }

          // Get the current date and time for logging
          const timestamp = new Date().toLocaleString();

          // Get or create a worksheet
          const sheetName = 'Test Steps Log';
          let worksheet;
          if (workbook.SheetNames.includes(sheetName)) {
            worksheet = workbook.Sheets[sheetName];
          } else {
            worksheet = xlsx.utils.aoa_to_sheet([['Timestamp', 'Step', 'Description', 'Status']]);
            xlsx.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, sheetName);
          }

          // Convert worksheet data to JSON to append new rows
          const sheetData = xlsx.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet, { header: 1 });
          sheetData.push([timestamp, step, description, status]);

          // Convert the updated JSON back to a worksheet and update the workbook
          const newWorksheet = xlsx.utils.aoa_to_sheet(sheetData);
          workbook.Sheets[sheetName] = newWorksheet;

          // Write back to the Excel file
          xlsx.writeFile(workbook, logFilePath);

          return null;
        },
      });
    },
  },
};

This code does the following:

It checks if the Excel file exists. If it does, it loads it; if not, it creates a new file.
It creates a new worksheet or loads the existing one.
It logs the timestamp, step, description, and status of each test step as a new row in the Excel file.
Step 2: Log Test Steps in Cypress Test Files
Now, from your Cypress test files, you can call this task to log each test step dynamically:

describe('Test with Excel Logging', () => {
  it('logs steps and status to Excel', () => {
    // Log Test Step 1
    cy.task('logTestStepToExcel', { 
      step: 'Step 1', 
      description: 'Logging into the application', 
      status: 'Passed' 
    });

    // Example test step
    cy.visit('https://example.com');
    
    // Log Test Step 2
    cy.task('logTestStepToExcel', { 
      step: 'Step 2', 
      description: 'Visited the homepage', 
      status: 'Passed' 
    });

    // Log Test Step 3
    cy.get('#loginButton').click().then(() => {
      cy.task('logTestStepToExcel', { 
        step: 'Step 3', 
        description: 'Clicked login button', 
        status: 'Passed' 
      });
    });

    // Example assertion
    cy.get('#welcomeMessage').should('contain', 'Welcome').then(() => {
      cy.task('logTestStepToExcel', { 
        step: 'Step 4', 
        description: 'Verified welcome message', 
        status: 'Passed' 
      });
    });
  });
});

Step 3: Run Your Cypress Tests
As your Cypress tests run, the test steps, descriptions, status, and timestamps will be logged into the test-steps-log.xlsx file in the root of your project directory.

Excel Log Output
When you open the Excel file after test execution, it will look like this:

Timestamp	Step	Description	Status
2024-09-26 11:10:30	Step 1	Logging into the application	Passed
2024-09-26 11:12:00	Step 2	Visited the homepage	Passed
2024-09-26 11:12:30	Step 3	Clicked login button	Passed
2024-09-26 11:13:00	Step 4	Verified welcome message	Passed
Additional Enhancements:
Log Errors: You can also log errors by modifying the status field for failed test steps.

Different Worksheets for Each Test Suite: You could modify the task to create a new worksheet for each test suite or test file by dynamically naming the worksheet based on the test name.

Conditional Logging: Add conditional logging based on the environment or the criticality of the steps.

Conclusion:
This approach will dynamically log your Cypress test steps, descriptions, statuses, and timestamps into an Excel file, which you can share with your manual QA team for better transparency and confidence in the automation results.






Here status Passed I want to show with Green color and Fail with red color
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To display "Passed" in green and "Failed" in red within the Excel file, you can use the xlsx library's cell styling capabilities. Here's how you can enhance the solution to include conditional formatting for the status:

Steps to Add Conditional Formatting (Green for "Passed", Red for "Failed"):
Install xlsx-style Library: The default xlsx library doesn't support styling, but you can use xlsx-style for that. Install it by running the following command:

npm install xlsx-style

Modify the Task to Apply Styles: Update the cypress.config.js file to use xlsx-style and apply cell styles based on the status.

Implementation
Step 1: Modify cypress.config.js with xlsx-style

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const xlsx = require('xlsx-style');

module.exports = {
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      on('task', {
        logTestStepToExcel({ step, description, status }) {
          const logFilePath = path.join(__dirname, 'test-steps-log.xlsx');

          // Create or load workbook
          let workbook;
          if (fs.existsSync(logFilePath)) {
            workbook = xlsx.readFile(logFilePath);
          } else {
            workbook = xlsx.utils.book_new();
          }

          // Create or load worksheet
          const sheetName = 'Test Steps Log';
          let worksheet;
          if (workbook.SheetNames.includes(sheetName)) {
            worksheet = workbook.Sheets[sheetName];
          } else {
            worksheet = xlsx.utils.aoa_to_sheet([['Timestamp', 'Step', 'Description', 'Status']]);
            xlsx.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, sheetName);
          }

          // Get the current date and time
          const timestamp = new Date().toLocaleString();

          // Convert worksheet data to JSON to append new rows
          const sheetData = xlsx.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet, { header: 1 });
          sheetData.push([timestamp, step, description, status]);

          // Convert the updated JSON back to a worksheet and update the workbook
          const newWorksheet = xlsx.utils.aoa_to_sheet(sheetData);
          
          // Style the status column based on the status value
          const statusRow = sheetData.length; // New row number
          const statusCell = `D${statusRow}`; // Status column 'D'

          newWorksheet[statusCell].s = {
            font: {
              color: { rgb: status === 'Passed' ? '00FF00' : 'FF0000' } // Green for Passed, Red for Failed
            }
          };

          workbook.Sheets[sheetName] = newWorksheet;

          // Write back to the Excel file
          xlsx.writeFile(workbook, logFilePath);

          return null;
        },
      });
    },
  },
};

Explanation:
Conditional Font Color:
The font color for the "Passed" status is set to green (rgb: '00FF00').
The font color for the "Failed" status is set to red (rgb: 'FF0000').
The statusCell refers to the cell in the status column, dynamically applying the correct style for the specific row.
Step 2: Use the Task in Test Files
You can log the test steps in the same way, but now the status will be colored accordingly in the Excel file:

describe('Test with Excel Logging', () => {
  it('logs steps and status to Excel with color formatting', () => {
    cy.task('logTestStepToExcel', { 
      step: 'Step 1', 
      description: 'Logging into the application', 
      status: 'Passed' // This will be green in Excel
    });

    cy.task('logTestStepToExcel', { 
      step: 'Step 2', 
      description: 'Login failed due to incorrect credentials', 
      status: 'Failed' // This will be red in Excel
    });
  });
});

Result in Excel:
When you open the Excel file, the "Status" column will now have the following colors:

"Passed" in green.
"Failed" in red.
Timestamp	Step	Description	Status
2024-09-26 11:10:30	Step 1	Logging into the application	Passed (Green)
2024-09-26 11:12:00	Step 2	Login failed due to incorrect credentials	Failed (Red)
Conclusion:
This approach enhances the logging system by adding dynamic status-based color coding for the test results in the Excel file. The "Passed" status will appear in green, and "Failed" will appear in red, making the test report more readable and informative for the manual QA team.

How I can add charts and dashboard in this excel file
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To add charts and dashboards in the Excel file where you log test steps, descriptions, and statuses dynamically, you can use a combination of xlsx for data manipulation and exceljs for more advanced features like chart creation. Unfortunately, xlsx-style doesn't support creating charts directly, so you would need to use exceljs to handle these additional functionalities.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use exceljs to achieve this:

Step 1: Install exceljs
First, you need to install the exceljs package, which supports both Excel file creation and charting.


npm install exceljs

Step 2: Modify the Cypress task to Use exceljs
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const ExcelJS = require('exceljs');

module.exports = {
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      on('task', {
        logTestStepToExcel({ step, description, status }) {
          const logFilePath = path.join(__dirname, 'test-steps-log.xlsx');

          // Initialize a new workbook or open an existing one
          let workbook = new ExcelJS.Workbook();
          if (fs.existsSync(logFilePath)) {
            // Load existing file if it exists
            return workbook.xlsx.readFile(logFilePath).then(() => {
              addTestStep(workbook, step, description, status);
            });
          } else {
            // Create new workbook and sheet
            const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet('Test Steps Log');
            sheet.columns = [
              { header: 'Timestamp', key: 'timestamp', width: 25 },
              { header: 'Step', key: 'step', width: 15 },
              { header: 'Description', key: 'description', width: 40 },
              { header: 'Status', key: 'status', width: 10 },
            ];
            return addTestStep(workbook, step, description, status);
          }
        },
      });
    },
  },
};

// Function to add test steps to the workbook
async function addTestStep(workbook, step, description, status) {
  const sheet = workbook.getWorksheet('Test Steps Log');
  
  // Append new row
  const timestamp = new Date().toLocaleString();
  const row = sheet.addRow({ timestamp, step, description, status });

  // Color "Passed" green and "Failed" red
  if (status === 'Passed') {
    row.getCell('status').font = { color: { argb: 'FF00FF00' } }; // Green
  } else if (status === 'Failed') {
    row.getCell('status').font = { color: { argb: 'FFFF0000' } }; // Red
  }

  // Create a chart on the second sheet (Dashboard)
  createChart(workbook, sheet);

  // Save workbook to file
  await workbook.xlsx.writeFile(path.join(__dirname, 'test-steps-log.xlsx'));
}

// Function to create a chart (Pie or Bar Chart)
function createChart(workbook, sheet) {
  // Get status data (Passed/Failed count)
  const passedCount = sheet.getColumn('status').values.filter(val => val === 'Passed').length;
  const failedCount = sheet.getColumn('status').values.filter(val => val === 'Failed').length;

  // Create a dashboard sheet if it doesn't exist
  let dashboardSheet = workbook.getWorksheet('Dashboard');
  if (!dashboardSheet) {
    dashboardSheet = workbook.addWorksheet('Dashboard');
  }

  // Clear any existing chart data
  dashboardSheet.getRows(1, dashboardSheet.rowCount).forEach(row => row.remove());

  // Add data for the chart
  dashboardSheet.addRow(['Status', 'Count']);
  dashboardSheet.addRow(['Passed', passedCount]);
  dashboardSheet.addRow(['Failed', failedCount]);

  // (Pseudo code) Add charting logic (ExcelJS doesn't support charts directly, you may need a workaround)
  // Create Pie or Bar Chart here using ExcelJS charting functions.
  // The actual implementation of charting may need manual creation in Excel.

  // Alternatively, the following can be done manually to create visualizations:
  // - Open the Excel file, create a chart in Excel using the data.
  // - Alternatively, use a reporting tool that can handle both data and charts.
}

Step 3: Explanation
Workbook and Worksheet:

The workbook is created or loaded based on the existing Excel file.
The test steps are logged to the "Test Steps Log" worksheet.
Chart Creation:

A separate "Dashboard" sheet is created where the data for Passed/Failed test cases is stored.
While exceljs does not directly support charts, you can organize the data in the "Dashboard" sheet and then manually create charts in Excel or use other charting libraries/tools to automate this.
Excel Chart Limitation:

As of now, exceljs doesn't natively support Excel charts. However, data preparation for a pie chart or bar chart can be done, and you can create the actual chart manually or by using a third-party tool. The script will log and store test data dynamically, which you can use for visualizations.
Step 4: Generating the Report
Whenever Cypress test cases run, this will log the test steps with a status in the test-steps-log.xlsx file and append the results in the Excel file. The "Dashboard" sheet will hold the summary of Passed/Failed tests.

Example Data in "Dashboard" Sheet:
Status	Count
Passed	10
Failed	2
Final Step: Create Charts in Excel
Once you open the Excel file, follow these steps to create a chart manually:

Navigate to the "Dashboard" sheet.
Highlight the Status and Count columns.
Go to the "Insert" tab in Excel.
Choose the chart type (e.g., Pie Chart, Bar Chart).
Excel will generate a chart based on the data.
Conclusion
This solution logs data to an Excel file using exceljs, and while creating charts is not fully automated, it allows you to prepare the data dynamically. You can then use Excel's built-in charting features to create visual dashboards based on your testing results.

@@@@@@@@@@@@ error @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The error you're encountering, xlsx.utils.book_new is not a function, occurs because the library you're using, xlsx-style, might not fully support the same API as the xlsx library, and it may be outdated. The xlsx-style library was a fork to handle cell styling in Excel files, but it's no longer actively maintained. It would be better to switch to the xlsx package, which now supports styling using a separate plugin or workarounds.

Solution
Switch to the xlsx library:

First, ensure you have the correct xlsx package installed by running:
npm install xlsx

Add Styles Using xlsx with Workarounds:

The basic xlsx library doesn't have full styling support out of the box, but there are workarounds or plugins like xlsx-style if you need advanced styling (though some functionality may differ).
Here's how to update the code to work with the standard xlsx library:

Updated Code Using xlsx:
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const XLSX = require('xlsx');

module.exports = {
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      on('task', {
        logTestStepToExcel({ step, description, status }) {
          const logFilePath = path.join(__dirname, 'test-steps-log.xlsx');

          // Create or load workbook
          let workbook;
          if (fs.existsSync(logFilePath)) {
            workbook = XLSX.readFile(logFilePath);
          } else {
            workbook = XLSX.utils.book_new(); // Creates a new workbook
          }

          // Create or load worksheet
          const sheetName = 'Test Steps Log';
          let worksheet;
          if (workbook.SheetNames.includes(sheetName)) {
            worksheet = workbook.Sheets[sheetName];
          } else {
            worksheet = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet([['Timestamp', 'Step', 'Description', 'Status']]);
            XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, sheetName);
          }

          // Get the current date and time
          const timestamp = new Date().toLocaleString();

          // Convert worksheet data to JSON to append new rows
          const sheetData = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet, { header: 1 });
          sheetData.push([timestamp, step, description, status]);

          // Convert the updated JSON back to a worksheet and update the workbook
          const newWorksheet = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet(sheetData);
          workbook.Sheets[sheetName] = newWorksheet;

          // Write back to the Excel file
          XLSX.writeFile(workbook, logFilePath);

          return null;
        },
      });
    },
  },
};

Note:
If you need to add more advanced styling, you'll have to use a combination of xlsx and custom logic (or use a library that supports styling like xlsx-style more effectively).

For basic reporting functionality, the xlsx package should work as expected without needing styling at this stage. Let me know if you require advanced styling, and I can guide you through alternative solutions.






You said:
Can you show me how excel report will look like

Here is how your Excel report would look, with columns for Timestamp, Step, Description, and Status. The "Passed" statuses are highlighted in green, and "Failed" statuses in red, making the test results visually clear and easy to read.

The code you provided will produce an Excel file named test-steps-log.xlsx, which will contain four columns: Timestamp, Step, Description, and Status. The file will log test steps dynamically as they occur, including the timestamp when each step was logged, the step name, a description, and the test result (status: "Passed" or "Failed").

Here’s a breakdown of the flow:

File Handling: If the file already exists, it will be read. If it doesn’t, a new one will be created.
Sheet Handling: If the sheet "Test Steps Log" exists, it appends to it. If it doesn’t, a new sheet is created with headers.
Adding Data: Each time you log a step, it appends a new row with the timestamp, step, description, and status to the sheet.
Save to File: Finally, it saves the updated workbook back to the Excel file.
Output Example:

Timestamp | Step | Description | Status
10/03/2024 11:00:01 | Login | User logs into the application | Passed
10/03/2024 11:05:15 | Upload | User uploads a file | Failed
However, this code doesn't include any conditional formatting for the "Status" column. If you want to style the cells (like coloring "Passed" in green and "Failed" in red), you would need to use a library like xlsx-style or a similar method to format the cells after the data is written.

Would you like to add styling or any other customizations to this code?

In the Output Example header Timestamp | Step | Description | Status I want to make with bold and highlighted with blue color

To achieve the formatting where the header row (Timestamp, Step, Description, Status) is bold and highlighted with a blue background in your Excel file, you can use the xlsx-style library (instead of xlsx, which doesn't support cell styling).

Below is an updated version of your code that applies bold formatting and a blue background color to the header row.

Updated Code with Header Formatting:

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const XLSX = require('xlsx-style'); // Ensure you're using xlsx-style for cell styling

module.exports = {
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      on('task', {
        logTestStepToExcel({ step, description, status }) {
          const logFilePath = path.join(__dirname, 'test-steps-log.xlsx');

          // Create or load workbook
          let workbook;
          if (fs.existsSync(logFilePath)) {
            workbook = XLSX.readFile(logFilePath);
          } else {
            workbook = XLSX.utils.book_new(); // Creates a new workbook
          }

          // Create or load worksheet
          const sheetName = 'Test Steps Log';
          let worksheet;
          if (workbook.SheetNames.includes(sheetName)) {
            worksheet = workbook.Sheets[sheetName];
          } else {
            // Create a new worksheet with headers
            worksheet = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet([['Timestamp', 'Step', 'Description', 'Status']]);
            XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, sheetName);

            // Apply formatting to header row
            const headerRange = ['A1', 'B1', 'C1', 'D1']; // Header cells

            headerRange.forEach((cell) => {
              worksheet[cell].s = {
                font: { bold: true }, // Make the font bold
                fill: { bgColor: { rgb: "0000FF" }, fgColor: { rgb: "0000FF" } }, // Blue background
                alignment: { horizontal: "center" }, // Center align the text
              };
            });
          }

          // Get the current date and time
          const timestamp = new Date().toLocaleString();

          // Convert worksheet data to JSON to append new rows
          const sheetData = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet, { header: 1 });
          sheetData.push([timestamp, step, description, status]);

          // Convert the updated JSON back to a worksheet and update the workbook
          const newWorksheet = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet(sheetData);
          workbook.Sheets[sheetName] = newWorksheet;

          // Write back to the Excel file
          XLSX.writeFile(workbook, logFilePath);

          return null;
        },
      });
    },
  },
};

Key Changes:
Bold and Blue Header:
I added a section that applies styling to the header row. The cells in the header (A1 to D1) will be bold and have a blue background color (rgb: "0000FF").
Center Alignment:
The header text is center-aligned for better visibility.
Notes:
The xlsx-style library supports cell styling like font changes and background colors, which is why it's used here instead of the standard xlsx.
If you're not familiar with xlsx-style, make sure it's installed by running:
bash

npm install xlsx-style


This will ensure that the header row is bold, center-aligned, and highlighted in blue, while subsequent rows will contain your test step data dynamically.

xlsx-style is not working any other workaround ?
If xlsx-style is not working, you can switch to using a combination of xlsx (for data handling) and a more feature-rich library like exceljs, which supports rich formatting options like bold text and background colors.

Here's a workaround using the exceljs library, which allows you to apply cell formatting, including bold text, color highlighting, and more.

Install exceljs:
First, you need to install exceljs by running:
npm install exceljs

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const ExcelJS = require('exceljs');

module.exports = {
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      on('task', {
        async logTestStepToExcel({ step, description, status }) {
          const logFilePath = path.join(__dirname, 'test-steps-log.xlsx');

          const workbook = new ExcelJS.Workbook();
          
          // Check if file exists
          if (fs.existsSync(logFilePath)) {
            await workbook.xlsx.readFile(logFilePath); // Load existing workbook
          } else {
            // Create a new workbook if it doesn't exist
            const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet('Test Steps Log');

            // Add header row with styling
            sheet.columns = [
              { header: 'Timestamp', key: 'timestamp', width: 25 },
              { header: 'Step', key: 'step', width: 30 },
              { header: 'Description', key: 'description', width: 40 },
              { header: 'Status', key: 'status', width: 15 },
            ];

            // Apply styles to the header row
            sheet.getRow(1).eachCell((cell) => {
              cell.font = { bold: true }; // Make the font bold
              cell.fill = {
                type: 'pattern',
                pattern: 'solid',
                fgColor: { argb: 'FF0000FF' }, // Blue background
                bgColor: { argb: 'FF0000FF' },
              };
              cell.alignment = { horizontal: 'center' }; // Center-align the text
              cell.font = { color: { argb: 'FFFFFFFF' }, bold: true }; // White text
            });
          }

          const sheet = workbook.getWorksheet('Test Steps Log');

          // Get the current date and time
          const timestamp = new Date().toLocaleString();

          // Add the test step data to the worksheet
          const row = sheet.addRow({
            timestamp,
            step,
            description,
            status,
          });

          // Apply styles to the status cell
          const statusCell = row.getCell('status');
          statusCell.font = { color: { argb: status === 'Passed' ? 'FF00FF00' : 'FFFF0000' } }; // Green for Passed, Red for Failed

          // Save the workbook to the file
          await workbook.xlsx.writeFile(logFilePath);

          return null;
        },
      });
    },
  },
};

Key Features:
ExcelJS Library:

This uses exceljs, which supports advanced features like cell formatting, custom fonts, and color schemes.
Header Styling:

The header row is styled with bold text, a blue background, and white font.
The header text is center-aligned for clarity.
Dynamic Data:

Test steps are dynamically added to the Excel file, and the status cell is colored green (Passed) or red (Failed).
Steps:
Install exceljs:
Run npm install exceljs to get started.
Run Your Test:
When the task logTestStepToExcel is triggered, it will either create or update the Excel file and apply the necessary formatting.

Final Output:
The Excel file will have a formatted header row with the following columns: Timestamp, Step, Description, and Status.
The status will be color-coded dynamically: green for "Passed" and red for "Failed".

Here’s an updated approach to avoid that error and ensure that columns stay within the valid Excel range.

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const ExcelJS = require('exceljs');

module.exports = {
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      on('task', {
        logTestStepToExcel({ step, description, status }) {
          const logFilePath = path.join(__dirname, 'test-steps-log.xlsx');

          // Create a workbook or load existing one
          let workbook = new ExcelJS.Workbook();
          if (fs.existsSync(logFilePath)) {
            return workbook.xlsx.readFile(logFilePath)
              .then(() => {
                const sheet = workbook.getWorksheet('Test Steps Log') || workbook.addWorksheet('Test Steps Log');

                // Append row data with timestamp
                appendRow(sheet, step, description, status);

                // Save workbook
                return workbook.xlsx.writeFile(logFilePath);
              });
          } else {
            const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet('Test Steps Log');

            // Add header with formatting
            sheet.columns = [
              { header: 'Timestamp', key: 'timestamp', width: 25 },
              { header: 'Step', key: 'step', width: 30 },
              { header: 'Description', key: 'description', width: 50 },
              { header: 'Status', key: 'status', width: 10 }
            ];

            // Apply styles to the header
            sheet.getRow(1).eachCell(cell => {

              cell.fill = {
                type: 'pattern',
                pattern: 'solid',
                fgColor: { argb: 'FF99CCFF' }, // Light blue fill
              };
            });

            // Append first row data with timestamp
            appendRow(sheet, step, description, status);

            // Save workbook
            return workbook.xlsx.writeFile(logFilePath);
          }
        }
      });
    }
  }
};

// Helper function to append a row and apply color formatting for the status
function appendRow(sheet, step, description, status) {
  const timestamp = new Date().toLocaleString();
  const row = sheet.addRow({ timestamp, step, description, status });

  // Apply color formatting to the status column based on pass/fail
  const statusCell = row.getCell(4); // Column 4 is the Status column
  if (status === 'Passed') {
    statusCell.font = { color: { argb: 'FF00FF00' } }; // Green for passed
  } else if (status === 'Failed') {
    statusCell.font = { color: { argb: 'FFFF0000' } }; // Red for failed
  }

  row.commit(); // Commit the row to ensure it is properly written
}



Here’s a sample test script file that you can use to call the cy.task('logTestStepToExcel', ...) from your Cypress tests.

Test Script File (e.g., test_spec.js):

describe('Excel Logging Test', () => {

  // Log the step to Excel with relevant details (step, description, status)
  const logTestStep = (step, description, status) => {
    cy.task('logTestStepToExcel', { step, description, status });
  };

  it('Step 1: Open Application', () => {
    // Example test step: Open the application
    cy.visit('https://example.com');
    logTestStep('Step 1: Open Application', 'Navigating to the application URL', 'Passed');
  });

  it('Step 2: Perform an assertion', () => {
    // Example test step: Check for element existence
    cy.get('h1').should('exist').then(() => {
      logTestStep('Step 2: Perform an assertion', 'Verify if the header element exists on the page', 'Passed');
    }).catch(() => {
      logTestStep('Step 2: Perform an assertion', 'Header element does not exist', 'Failed');
    });
  });

  it('Step 3: Click on a button', () => {
    // Example test step: Click on a button
    cy.get('button#submit').click().then(() => {
      logTestStep('Step 3: Click on a button', 'Clicked the submit button', 'Passed');
    }).catch(() => {
      logTestStep('Step 3: Click on a button', 'Failed to click the submit button', 'Failed');
    });
  });

  it('Step 4: Verify some functionality', () => {
    // Example test step: Perform a different action
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard').then(() => {
      logTestStep('Step 4: Verify Dashboard', 'Verify the user is redirected to the dashboard', 'Passed');
    }).catch(() => {
      logTestStep('Step 4: Verify Dashboard', 'User is not redirected to the dashboard', 'Failed');
    });
  });

});
